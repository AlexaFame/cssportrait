            You'll be safe in my romance, babe, uh
Label's fading but
I see you cravin' for more
You're denying it
But you ain't controlling your actions
Keep me guessing but
Don't keep me waiting for us
Oh, I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cause I only matter when he's not around
Oh, but I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give, mhm
Got my heart on my sleeve
I'm beggin' the heavens to be good to me
Are you obsessive love?
'Cause I'm tolerating all of your desires
I'll keep you wanting me more, ooh
Leave but I'll keep you comin'
I'm sure it's my love that got you suffocated
Oh, I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cause I only matter when he's not around
Oh, but I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give, mhm
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Take all the love that I give
All that I
You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cause you got more options
You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cause you got more options
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Love
I've been on the road for hours all alone
Just to get to you
Love
Oh, I could do this every day
So come my way, yeah
Say a prayer
Say a prayer before I turn off the lights, mmh, ohh
Get undressed (get undressed)
Get undressed, there ain't no reason to hide (reason to hide)
'cause not everybody's obsessed with a body
I'm up for the beauty and light from within
You have me already, this ain't ordinary
My hands get unsteady every time you let me in
I've been attached with the feeling
Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side
Stuck in the same page for ages
But, baby, you're ageless
And fate is in our hands somehow
I'm happy with you
I'm happy with you (happy with you)
I'm happy with you (happy with you)
I'm happy with you (happy with you)
I'm happy with you, babe
What I'd do to have you under my sheets
What I would do to feel your heat
You turn a glow into a fire
My love don't expire, you're my lifeline, lifeline
You are all I crave and all I seek
Yet I'll take it day by day
don't give a fuck 'bout the wait
Man, that's a promise, I'm bein' honest
You, nothing compares to me and you
You, you are the one I belong to
Oh, I've been attached with the feeling
Of love reciprocating and waking up with you by my side
Stuck in the same page for ages (same page for ages)
But, baby, you're ageless (baby, you're ageless)
And fate is in our hands somehow
I'm happy with you
I'm happy with you (happy with you, happy with you)
I'm happy with you
I'm happy with you
I'm happy with you, babe
[Verse 1]
There are times when I'm lying in my bed
How I bellow and cry from this stupid get
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
Almost rubbed-out, swelling as I keep on

[Pre-Chorus]
Dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
Heaven knows how embittered I am

[Chorus]
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings and made her mine
For all eternity
Now this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? (Oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I feel like catching forty winks
Being up all night in this elbow room that puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now my lips are burning, and my eyes are hurting

[Pre-Chorus]
From this fumes I make, still I light another cigarette, just to pass my time
Oh, heaven knows how embittered I am

[Chorus]
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings and made her mine
For all eternity
Now this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? (Oh-oh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearin' me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holdin' me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holdin' me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"
You'll be safe in my romance, babe, uh
Label's fading but
